2023-09-14: Only two use case narratives so far. 
2023-09-21: Functional flow is quite simple… but might be adequate. 
2023-09-28: “Backend” architecture is reasonable but “front end” really doesn’t make sense. 
2023-10-04: Good that you have a class diagram, but I’m SURE there must be more than one class in your domain!

No coding standards! (That was last week’s assignment)

Good that your python files have header comments, but PLEASE include the author name.

Derived files like the python cache files should not be in the repository. 

2023-10-12:  Thank you for extracting your coding standards into a separate file. But you don’t have any rules about comments.

Good Lab 6 reports! (You really only needed to create one, but that’s fine.)

Good progress with code! But please put the actual code author(s) in the header comments.
